Unlike melt and pour, cold process soap is made from scratch using oils and lye. The saponification process transforms these ingredients into a gentle, moisturizing bar of soap.\n\nTo get started, you will need a reliable soap calculator to determine the correct lye amount for your oil blend. Safety is paramount — always wear gloves and eye protection when working with lye.\n\nThe beauty of cold process soap is the endless customization. You can add clays, botanicals, essential oils, and natural colorants to create truly unique bars. The cure time of 4–6 weeks allows the soap to harden and the pH to mellow, resulting in a gentle, long-lasting bar.\n\nAt BONITARA, we offer all the premium ingredients you need to start your soap making journey — from cosmetic-grade bases and clays to pure essential oils and beautiful molds.' },

Made from natural soybeans, they burn cleaner and longer than paraffin candles while providing an excellent fragrance throw.\n\nThe key to a perfect soy candle lies in temperature control. Melt your soy wax to 75–80°C, then allow it to cool to 65°C before adding your fragrance oil at 6–10% concentration. Pour at 55–60°C for the best adhesion to your container.\n\nWick selection is crucial — too small and your candle will tunnel; too large and it will burn too hot. As a general rule, use a wick sized for your container diameter and always test before producing in bulk.\n\nFragrance selection is where the magic happens. Our luxury candle fragrance oil sets are specifically tested for soy wax performance, ensuring excellent hot and cold throw with no performance issues.' },

Our crystal clear epoxy resin has minimal yellowing and excellent self-leveling properties. Always mix at the correct ratio (2:1 by volume) and mix thoroughly for 3–5 minutes to ensure complete curing.\n\nColor is where resin art truly shines. Alcohol inks create beautiful fluid effects, while mica powders add dimensional shimmer. Gold leaf flakes add an unmistakable luxury touch. The key is to work in layers, allowing each layer to partially cure before adding the next.\n\nSafety is important — always wear nitrile gloves and work in a well-ventilated area.

Every fragrance is composed of three layers: top notes, heart notes, and base notes.\n\nTop notes are the first impression — they are light, fresh, and evaporate quickly. Citrus, mint, and light florals are classic top notes. They last 15–30 minutes on skin.\n\nHeart notes form the core of the fragrance and emerge as the top notes fade. Rose, jasmine, and lavender are beloved heart notes. They last 2–4 hours.\n\nBase notes are the foundation — rich, deep, and long-lasting. Sandalwood, oud, vanilla, and musk are classic base notes. They can last 6+ hours on skin and anchor the entire fragrance.\n\nWhen creating your own blends, aim for a balance of 20–30% top notes, 50–60% heart notes, and 20–30% base notes. Our fragrance oil collection covers all three categories, giving you everything you need to create your signature scent.' },
