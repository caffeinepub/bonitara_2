# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the "Add New Product" modal in the Admin Dashboard to have a solid white background instead of the current transparent/semi-transparent grey background.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the transparent/semi-transparent background of the "Add New Product" modal/panel in `AdminDashboardPage.tsx` with a solid white (`bg-white`) background.

**User-visible outcome:** The "Add New Product" modal now displays with a clean solid white background, making all form fields (Name, SKU, Description, Price, Stock, Category, Image URL) and buttons clearly legible without the page content bleeding through.
