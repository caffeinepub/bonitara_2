  "summary": "The diff modifies App.tsx to add admin route handling with isAdminRoute() helper and imports for AdminLoginPage, AdminDashboardPage, and AdminProtectedRoute. AdminLoginPage.tsx is also updated with redirect logic and hash-based navigation. The changes appear to address REQ-1's core routing fix. However, the App.tsx diff is truncated so full verification of the route rendering logic, Header/Footer exclusion, and AdminProtectedRoute wiring cannot be confirmed with certainty.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "AdminProtectedRoute correctly guards the dashboard and redirects unauthenticated users to the admin login page.",
      "reason": "The App.tsx diff is truncated before showing the actual route rendering switch/conditional block. It is impossible to confirm that AdminProtectedRoute is properly wired around the AdminDashboardPage route in the JSX. While AdminProtectedRoute is imported, the actual usage in the routing tree is not visible in the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The admin route does not render the shared Header and Footer components, consistent with the existing exclusion logic in App.tsx.",
      "reason": "The isAdminRoute() helper function is defined in the truncated App.tsx, but the actual JSX that conditionally renders Header/Footer based on this function is not visible in the truncated diff, so it cannot be confirmed as correctly implemented.",
