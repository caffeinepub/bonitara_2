  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by extracting the ProductForm component to the top level of the module (outside AdminDashboardPage), which prevents React from unmounting/remounting it on every keystroke and fixes the keyboard input focus-loss bug. The implementation addresses all acceptance criteria: stable component identity prevents re-mounting/flickering, form state is lifted to the parent and passed as props so it does not re-initialize on keystrokes, and all controlled inputs receive onChange handlers. The approach matches the root cause analysis described in the requirement.",
