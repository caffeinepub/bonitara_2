  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-36 (manual email/password login and registration system) comprehensively, including backend Motoko functions, frontend login/register pages with tabs, protected routes, and header integration. REQ-37 (comprehensive mobile/responsive pass) shows partial evidence — some pages have responsive classes added — but there is no dedicated, systematic responsive pass across all 15+ required pages with explicit mobile breakpoint handling.",

      "requirement": "Comprehensive mobile and responsive layout pass across ALL pages: Home, Category, ProductDetail, Cart, Checkout, Profile, OrderHistory, Blog, Wholesale, FAQ, ShippingPolicy, Terms, ReturnPolicy, ContactUs, and AdminDashboard — with 320px/768px/1280px breakpoints, 44px touch targets, no overflow, proper product grids, hamburger menu, scrollable modals, etc.",
      "reason": "The diff modifies only a handful of page files (HomePage, OrderHistoryPage, ProfilePage, AdminDashboardPage) and components (Header, Footer). Pages like CategoryPage, ProductDetailPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage, BlogListingPage, BlogPostPage, WholesalePage, FAQPage, ShippingPolicyPage, TermsPage, ReturnPolicyPage, ContactPage are listed only in the file-summaries metadata with brief descriptions and no evidence of responsive-specific changes being applied. There is no systematic pass with documented breakpoint handling across all 15+ required pages.",
