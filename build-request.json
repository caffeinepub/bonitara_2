      "text": "Fix the routing configuration in App.tsx so that navigating to the /admin route correctly renders the AdminLoginPage (or AdminDashboardPage if already authenticated). The hash-based router must handle the /admin path and all sub-routes (e.g., /admin/dashboard) without falling through to a 404 or blank screen.",

        "AdminProtectedRoute correctly guards the dashboard and redirects unauthenticated users to the admin login page.",
        "The admin route does not render the shared Header and Footer components, consistent with the existing exclusion logic in App.tsx.",
        "All other existing routes continue to work correctly after the fix."

    "Do not modify files under frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts, frontend/src/main.tsx, or frontend/src/components/ui.",
